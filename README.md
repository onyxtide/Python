# Python Learning Journey 🐍

## About This Repository

This repository documents my structured approach to mastering Python programming. I've recently streamlined my GitHub portfolio by removing previous repositories to maintain a focused, curated collection of my current work and learning progress.

## Learning Path

I'm building my Python skills through multiple high-quality resources:

- **[Codedex](https://www.codedex.io/)** - Interactive Python fundamentals and projects
- **Udemy Courses** - Specialized Python topics and real-world applications
- **Coursera** - Academic approach to computer science and Python programming

## Current Focus

- Python fundamentals and syntax
- Data structures and algorithms
- Problem-solving and computational thinking
- Building towards data science and bioinformatics applications

## Progress Tracking

*This section will be updated regularly as I progress through courses*


**Note:** This is a living repository that grows with my learning. All code represents my current understanding and will evolve as I advance through the curriculum.
